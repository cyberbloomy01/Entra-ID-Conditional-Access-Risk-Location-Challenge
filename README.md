# Entra-ID-Conditional-Access-Risk-Location-Challenge
Project Summary

This project demonstrates the implementation of Conditional Access policies in Microsoft Entra ID, Focused on risk-based and location-based access controls. The objective is to enhance identity security by enforcing sign-in restrictions based on geographic location and user risk levels.

Objectives:
Block sign-ins from specific countries (e.g., Nigeria) for targeted users.
Enforce password change for users with elevated risk.
Apply granular access controls using named locations and user risk levels.

Environment Assumption
Microsoft Entra ID tenant with Conditional Access enabled.
Test user accounts (e.g., Test user 1 & 2) are available for policy scoping.
Named location "Nigeria" created using country/region selection.
User risk detection configured via Microsoft Identity Protection.
Admin access to Entra portal for policy creation and testing.
